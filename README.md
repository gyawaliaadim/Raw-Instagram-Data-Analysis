# Raw Instagram Data Analyis — Instagram Profile Data Analysis (Pure Python)

InstaScope is a simple Instagram profile data analysis project built using pure Python as part of The Ultimate Job Ready Data Science Course by CodeWithHarry.
This project works with raw Instagram account data stored in JSON format and extracts meaningful insights using only Python’s built-in data structures and control flow—no Pandas, NumPy, or external libraries.

The goal is to understand how basic data analysis works under the hood before relying on high-level tools.

🚀 Features

Reads raw Instagram account data from JSON

Identifies the account with:

Maximum posts

Maximum followers

Maximum following

Analyzes account categories (e.g., Digital Creator, Business, Non-profit)

Counts total categories and number of accounts in each

Fully implemented using core Python only

📌 Why This Matters

Most beginners jump straight to libraries and miss the fundamentals.
This project focuses on loop-based analysis, comparisons, and frequency counting, which are the building blocks of real-world data analytics.

By doing everything in pure Python, the project strengthens:

Logical thinking

Data traversal skills

Understanding of how metrics are computed internally

This is the foundation that makes tools like Pandas feel obvious later—not magical.

🛠️ Usage

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the main Python script using the Python interpreter. The program will load the JSON dataset and print analytical insights directly to the console, including top accounts and category distributions.
