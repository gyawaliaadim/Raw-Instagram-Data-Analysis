# Raw Instagram Data Analyis (Pure Python)

Simple Instagram profile data analysis project built using pure Python as part of The Ultimate Job Ready Data Science Course by CodeWithHarry.
This project works with raw Instagram account data stored in txt format and extracts meaningful insights using only Python’s built-in data structures and control flow—no Pandas, NumPy, or external libraries.

The goal is to understand how basic data analysis works under the hood before relying on high-level tools.

## 🚀 Features

- Reads raw Instagram account data from txt
- Converts each account into a dictionary
- Gets the number of posts, followers, following, catogory etc of the account
- Stores them into a dictionary
- Identifies the account with:
  - Maximum posts
  - Maximum followers
  - Maximum following
- Analyzes account categories (e.g., Digital Creator, Business, Non-profit)

Fully implemented using core Python only

## 📌 Why This Matters

Most beginners jump straight to libraries and miss the fundamentals.
This project focuses on loop-based analysis, comparisons, and frequency counting, which are the building blocks of real-world data analytics.

By doing everything in pure Python, the project strengthens:

- Logical thinking
- Data traversal skills
- Understanding of how metrics are computed internally
- This is the foundation that makes tools like Pandas feel obvious later—not magical.

## 🛠️ Usage

Open jupyter notebook or lab inside of the main folder and open main.ipynb
